## Auto Attendants

Auto-Attendant is a phone system feature for providing automated call answering, caller messaging and call transfer of inbound callers to individual users or groups or other automated informational  messages within a business phone system.

If your service is set up with an Auto-Attendant, you can allow callers to initially try to reach a live person directly or use the Auto Attendant to direct the caller  to their destination. Alternatively, you can choose to setup any of your phone numbers on your account as Auto Attendants.

To configure the auto attendants, navigate to **Settings > Auto Attendants**.
